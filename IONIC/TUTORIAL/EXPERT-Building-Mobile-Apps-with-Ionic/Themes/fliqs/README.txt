Before being able to run this code yourself, you will need to generate your own new Ionic 2 project (if you need help with this, just read one of the 'Getting Ready' sections from any of the application walkthroughs in the book). After that, you will be able to do the following to get the theme up and running:

1. Replace the 'src' folder in the project you generated with the 'src' folder in the download
2. Run the 'ionic serve' command
