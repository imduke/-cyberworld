STANDARD LICENSE

The Standard License grants you an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the resource you have purchased.

You are licensed to use the resource to create one End Product for yourself, or for a single client.

An End Product is a customised implementation of the purchased resource, that requires an application of skill and effort.

ALLOWED USING THIS LICENSE:

You may use the resource to create a single End Product, to be used either non-commercially or commercially.

You may create one End Product for a client, and you may sell the End Product to your client. Upon selling the End Product to the client, this license will be transferred to the client.

You may remix, transform, and build upon the material in any way you see fit. The resulting work is subject to the terms of this license.

NOT ALLOWED WITH THIS LICENSE:

You may not sell the End Product to multiple clients.

You may not create the End Product for yourself and for one or more clients.

You may not re-distribute the resource as stock, in a tool or template, or with source files, even if you modify the resource.

You may not make the resource available without changes, or with only superficial changes.

If this license is breached, it may be terminated at any time.
